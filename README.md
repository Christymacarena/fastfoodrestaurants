How to research new Geography market (US in the case) and where to open restaurants there?
Here is my easy and scalable script research.

So imagine that you have easy going restaurant chain in one Country. But to infinity and beyond!
Here is a script of how you can proceed with quolity research and visualisation.
*Inside is quite detailed step by step description buuuut, main goals of the Code:

1. Washing data and merging data together - because we have 3 diffrent datasets.

2. Actualizing data with date visualization research

3. Choose besties

4. So after all manipulation we have a map, where we can see how many restaurants exist per each neighbourhood

And we can choose where to open though:
